# Oanitic Issues
Incase you notice a bug or other problems or have a suggestion, leave them here

## Some rules
- Please make sure that your issues are clear and readable. Do not make an issue that goes like this: getting issues when using XYZ please fix
- Do not spam your issue. I know the pain but i usually don't always pay attention to github in general. If the issue is urgent, Post it in the discord linked on the website.
- If i close your issue with seemingly no reason you might have broken any of these rules, If you think it was a mistake you can tell me and i will re-open it

## Notice
- Since oanitic is no longer supported as of 05.10.2023 any bugs or crashes won't be fixed anymore
